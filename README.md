# Memory-Game
A console-based memory game using **C#** and the **.NET** framework.
The game allows two players, either two humans or a human and a computer opponent, to take turns revealing hidden pairs of letters on a grid.
The objective is to find matching pairs, with the player who finds the most pairs declared the winner.
The project involved several key components, such as player name input, game mode selection, board setup, and input validation, all implemented in **Visual Studio**.

The logic for the computer opponent using the **Random Class** for generating computer moves. 
The game logic, which includes classes, constructors, enums, properties, and access modifiers, is separated from the user interface to ensure maintainability and potential future expansion.
The **Ex02.ConsoleUtils.dll** external assembly was used for screen clearing, while **System.Threading.Thread.Sleep** was employed to create a delay when revealing non-matching pairs.

Overall, the project emphasized the use of object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts and demonstrated the effective application of C# 2.0 and .NET capabilities in building a console-based application.
